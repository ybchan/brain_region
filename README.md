## Mapping Behavior to Brain Regions using Deep Learning 

How do our brains control behavior? It has been a fascinating question that many biologists try to answer. 
In this project, I use deep learning techniques (i.e. 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)) to correlate 
behavioral outcomes with various brain scan images and map them to specific brain regions. It allows us to 
identify brain regions that regulate behavior.
